It loves to bathe in the grit of dry, sandy areas. By sand bathing, the Pokémon rids itself of dirt and moisture clinging to its body.
It burrows into the ground to create its nest. If hard stones impede its tunneling, it uses its sharp claws to shatter them and then carries on digging.

For Poliwag, swimming is easier than walking. The swirl pattern on its belly is actually part of the Pokémon's innards showing through the skin.
In rivers with fast-flowing water, this Pokémon will cling to a rock by using its thick lips, which act like a suction cup.

Staring at the swirl on its belly causes drowsiness. This trait of Poliwhirl's has been used in place of lullabies to get children to go to sleep.
This Pokémon's sweat is a slimy mucus. When captured, Poliwhirl can slither from its enemies' grasp and escape.

Tentacool is not a particularly strong swimmer. It drifts across the surface of shallow seas as it searches for prey.
This Pokémon is mostly made of water. A Tentacool out in the ocean is very hard to spot, because its body blends in with the sea.

Slowpoke became Slowbro when a Shellder bit on to its tail. Sweet flavors seeping from the tail make the Shellder feel as if its life is a dream.
Being bitten by a Shellder shocked this Pokémon into standing on two legs. If the Shellder lets go, it seems Slowbro will turn back into a Slowpoke.

At times, Magnemite runs out of electricity and ends up on the ground. If you give batteries to a grounded Magnemite, it'll start moving again.
It subsists on electricity. As Magnemite flies, it emits electromagnetic waves from the units on each side of its body.

Its large and hard pincer has 10,000-horsepower strength. However, being so big, it is unwieldy to move.
Its oversized claw is very powerful, but when it's not in battle, the claw just gets in the way.

The cry of a Whismur is over 100 decibels. If you're close to a Whismur when it lets out a cry, you'll be stuck with an all-day headache.
When Whismur cries, the sound of its own voice startles it, making the Pokémon cry even louder. It cries until it's exhausted, then it falls asleep.

It nimbly dashes about to avoid getting pecked by bird Pokémon that would love to make off with its small, nutrient-rich storage ball.
The deeper a Cherubi's red, the more nutrients it has stockpiled in its body. And the sweeter and tastier its small ball!

Perhaps seeking company, it approaches children. However, it often quickly runs away again when the children play too roughly with it.
The gathering of many souls gave rise to this Pokémon. During humid seasons, they seem to appear in abundance.

It grabs people and Pokémon and carries them off somewhere. Where do they go? Nobody knows.

The black fur that covers this Pokémon's body is dense and springy. Even sharp fangs bounce right off.

These Pokémon seem to enjoy living with humans. Even a Stoutland caught in the wild will warm up to people in about three days.
Stoutland is immensely proud of its impressive moustache. It's said that moustache length is what determines social standing among this species.

It steals things from people just to amuse itself with their frustration. A rivalry exists between this Pokémon and Nickit.
Opponents that get drawn in by its adorable behavior come away with stinging scratches from its claws and stinging pride from its laughter.

It's as hard as steel, but apparently a long soak in water will cause it to soften a bit.
When it detects a noise, it starts to move. The energy core inside it makes this Pokémon slightly warm to the touch.

If you see its orange crystals start to glow, be wary. It's about to fire off bursts of energy.
It relies on sound in order to monitor what's in its vicinity. When angered, it will attack without ever changing the direction it's facing.

This hardy Pokémon can often be found on construction sites and in mines, working alongside people and Copperajah.
Although its energy blasts can blow away a dump truck, they have a limitation— they can only be fired when the sun is out.

It shows off its muscles to Machoke and other Gurdurr. If it fails to measure up to the other Pokémon, it lies low for a little while.
Gurdurr excels at demolition—construction is not its forte. In any case, there's skill in the way this Pokémon wields its metal beam.

Concrete mixed by Conkeldurr is much more durable than normal concrete, even when the compositions of the two materials are the same.
When going all out, this Pokémon throws aside its concrete pillars and leaps at opponents to pummel them with its fists.

It weakens its prey with sound waves intense enough to cause headaches, then entangles them with its sticky tongue.
On occasion, their cries are sublimely pleasing to the ear. Palpitoad with larger lumps on their bodies can sing with a wider range of sounds.

It scatters cotton all over the place as a prank. If it gets wet, it'll become too heavy to move and have no choice but to answer for its mischief.
As long as this Pokémon bathes in sunlight, its cotton keeps growing. If too much cotton fluff builds up, Whimsicott tears it off and scatters it.

Petilil appears around sources of clean water. Boiling leaves from this Pokémon's head results in a liquid that's sometimes used as a bug repellent.
The deeper the color of a Petilil's leaves, the healthier the Pokémon is. Petilil sometimes makes its home in a well-tended field or flowerbed.

This Pokémon eats trash, which turns into poison inside its body. The main component of the poison depends on what sort of trash was eaten.
The toxic liquid it launches from its right arm is so virulent that it can kill a weakened creature instantly.

Zorua is a timid Pokémon. This disposition seems to be what led to the development of Zorua's ability to take on the forms of other creatures.
Zorua sometimes transforms into a person and goes into cities to search for food. When Zorua does this, it usually takes on the form of a child.

It defends itself by launching spikes, but its aim isn't very good at first. Only after a lot of practice will it improve.
Mossy caves are their preferred dwellings. Enzymes contained in mosses help Ferroseed's spikes grow big and strong.

Evolves into Liepard-0 @ 20 (LevelUp) [0]

When Klang goes all out, the minigear links up perfectly with the outer part of the big gear, and this Pokémon's rotation speed increases sharply.
Many companies in the Galar region choose Klang as their logo. This Pokémon is considered the symbol of industrial technology.

This Pokémon appears just before someone passes away, so it's feared as an emissary of death.
It lurks in cities, pretending to be a lamp. Once it finds someone whose death is near, it will trail quietly after them.

In homes illuminated by Chandelure instead of lights, funerals were a constant occurrence— or so it's said.

These Pokémon nest in the ground and use their tusks to crush hard berries. Crushing berries is also how they test each other's strength.
They play with each other by knocking their large tusks together. Their tusks break sometimes, but they grow back so quickly that it isn't a concern.

Evolves into Unfezant-0 @ 32 (LevelUp) [0]

After battle, this Pokémon carefully sharpens its tusks on river rocks. It needs to take care of its tusks—if one breaks, it will never grow back.
Its skin is as hard as a suit of armor. Fraxure's favorite strategy is to tackle its opponents, stabbing them with its tusks at the same time.

Its resilient tusks are its pride and joy. It licks up dirt to take in the minerals it needs to keep its tusks in top condition.
While usually kindhearted, it can be terrifying if angered. Tusks that can slice through steel beams are how Haxorus deals with its adversaries.

It has a strange physiology that responds to electricity. When together with Karrablast, Shelmet evolves for some reason.

It chooses a Pangoro as its master and then imitates its master's actions. This is how it learns to battle and hunt for prey.
Wanting to make sure it's taken seriously, Pancham's always giving others a glare. But if it's not focusing, it ends up smiling.

Though Espurr's expression never changes, behind that blank stare is an intense struggle to contain its devastating psychic power.

At a distance, it launches its sharp feathers while flying about. If the enemy gets too close, Rowlet switches tactics and delivers vicious kicks.
During the day, it builds up energy via photosynthesis. At night, it flies silently through the sky, on the prowl for prey.

It throws one knifelike feather after another at its enemies, and each one precisely strikes a weak point. These feathers are known as blade quills.
It never slacks when it comes to the task of cleaning its feathers. Thorough preening keeps it looking spiffy and its blade quills nice and sharp.

It excels at violent, no-holds-barred battles. The temperature of the flames that issue from its navel exceeds 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit.
Incineroar's rough and aggressive behavior is its most notable trait, but the way it helps out small Pokémon shows that it has a kind side as well.

It creates special bouncy balloons to send at its opponents. When the balloons pop, the sheer force of their bursting is what deals damage.

It eats berries nonstop—a habit that has made it more resilient than it looks. It'll show up on farms, searching for yet more berries.

It stashes berries in its tail—so many berries that they fall out constantly. But this Pokémon is a bit slow-witted, so it doesn't notice the loss.
Common throughout the Galar region, this Pokémon has strong teeth and can chew through the toughest of berry shells.

Its curly fleece is such an effective cushion that this Pokémon could fall off a cliff and stand right back up at the bottom, unharmed.
If its fleece grows too long, Wooloo won't be able to move. Cloth made with the wool of this Pokémon is surprisingly strong.

Weave a carpet from its springy wool, and you end up with something closer to a trampoline. You'll start to bounce the moment you set foot on it.
Its majestic horns are meant only to impress the opposite gender. They never see use in battle.

Apparently the itch of its teething impels it to snap its jaws at anything in front of it.

It's usually peaceful, but the vandalism of mines enrages it. Offenders will be incinerated with flames that reach 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit.
While it's engaged in battle, its mountain of coal will burn bright red, sending off sparks that scorch the surrounding area.

It spends its entire life inside an apple. It hides from its natural enemies, bird Pokémon, by pretending it's just an apple and nothing more.
As soon as it's born, it burrows into an apple. Not only does the apple serve as its food source, but the flavor of the fruit determines its evolution.

This Pokémon has a jaw that's as sharp as a spear and as strong as steel. Apparently Barraskewda's flesh is surprisingly tasty, too.
It spins its tail fins to propel itself, surging forward at speeds of over 100 knots before ramming prey and spearing into them.

It stores poison in an internal poison sac and secretes that poison through its skin. If you touch this Pokémon, a tingling sensation follows.
It manipulates the chemical makeup of its poison to produce electricity. The voltage is weak, but it can cause a tingling paralysis.

It stores flammable gas in its body and uses it to generate heat. The yellow sections on its belly get particularly hot.
It wraps prey up with its heated body, cooking them in its coils. Once they're well-done, it will voraciously nibble them down to the last morsel.

It's very curious, but its means of investigating things is to try to punch them with its tentacles. The search for food is what brings it onto land.
Its tentacles tear off easily, but it isn't alarmed when that happens—it knows they'll grow back. It's about as smart as a three-year-old.

Evolves into Salazzle-0 @ 33 (LevelUpFemale) [0]

Powerful legs and jaws made it the apex predator of its time. Its own overhunting of its prey was what drove it to extinction.
Its mighty legs are capable of running at speeds exceeding 40 mph, but this Pokémon can't breathe unless it's underwater.

Though it's able to capture prey by freezing its surroundings, it has trouble eating the prey afterward because its mouth is on top of its head.
The skin on its face is impervious to attack, but breathing difficulties made this Pokémon go extinct anyway.

Evolves into Bewear-0 @ 27 (LevelUp) [0]

Its body resembles polished metal, and it's both lightweight and strong. The only drawback is that it rusts easily.
The special metal that composes its body is very light, so this Pokémon has considerable agility. It lives in caves because it dislikes the rain.

After being reborn as a ghost Pokémon, Dreepy wanders the areas it used to inhabit back when it was alive in prehistoric seas.
If this weak Pokémon is by itself, a mere child could defeat it. But if Dreepy has friends to help it train, it can evolve and become much stronger.

It's capable of flying faster than 120 mph. It battles alongside Dreepy and dotes on them until they successfully evolve.
Without a Dreepy to place on its head and care for, it gets so uneasy it'll try to substitute any Pokémon it finds for the missing Dreepy.

When it isn't battling, it keeps Dreepy in the holes on its horns. Once a fight starts, it launches the Dreepy like supersonic missiles.
Apparently the Dreepy inside Dragapult's horns eagerly look forward to being launched out at Mach speeds.

Once the vines on Zarude's body tear off, they become nutrients in the soil. This helps the plants of the forest grow.

In battle, this Pokémon swings around two thick vines. If these vines slammed into a 10-story building, they could easily topple it.
Huge amounts of pollen burst from it with the force of a volcanic eruption. Breathing in too much of the pollen can cause fainting.

Although this Pokémon is normally zoned out, its expression abruptly sharpens on occasion. The cause for this seems to lie in Slowpoke's diet.
